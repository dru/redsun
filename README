This is the Red Sun Ruby library. It can parse and write SWF files and can translate Ruby code into AS3 code inside a SWF.

It works moderately well...

The flash directory is the implementation of the Ruby VM in AS3. It is a
Flex Builder 3 project directory that is pure Actionscript (not a Flex
project).

The chromosphere directory is an AIR application that can launch Ruby
code in a new AIR Window for experimentation and learning.

Chromosphere relies on a web server running on localhost that can compile
Ruby source code into bytecode. It can be started by executing the following
command from the root directory of Red Sun:

ruby -Ilib -Iresearch lib/redsun/ramaze.rb
