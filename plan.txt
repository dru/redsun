pretty print as3 so I can read it and understand what's happening
write some as3, compile it, and look at the output

translate basic ruby calls to as3
insert byte codes into existing abc_file
- have to search/update constant_pool - strings, multinames, namespaces

goals:
- enable code generation from Ruby to AS3 bytecode
-- implement methods and event handlers
-- shortcuts for properties and handling changes in commitProperties()
-- automatic xxChanged:boolean generation and callback in commitProperties() based on some convention
- enable tx of Flash vector definitions
-- transform vectors into Degrafa definitions
- transform fonts into Degrafa definitions
- pointcut expressions to modify existing methods

Awful things I don't want to think about:
* converting floating point numbers


New plans:

* Implement a bunch of AS3 to support Ruby
* Implement different send_external on Object.prototype and RObject.prototype
* Don't use AS3 classes to implement Ruby classes
* Ruby inheritance hierarchy implemented in plain AS3 to support proper semantics and method dispatch

Problems:
* How do you "subclass" Sprite; implement a Sprite object in Ruby if you cannot inherit from flash.display.Sprite?
* method for proxying a typed class? include_typed_class Flash::Display::Sprite
